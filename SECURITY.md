# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately using GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the repository’s **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Include as much detail as possible (repro steps, affected versions, impact).

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days and will coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.
